# RandomWisdomDistributor
Project: Random Wisdom Distributor Concept: Users can call a function on the smart contract to receive a random piece of wisdom from a predefined list. It’s a playful project that’s simple yet interactive, showcasing smart contract deployment and random number generation on the Scroll network.
Project Title: Random Wisdom Distributor
Description:
The Random Wisdom Distributor is a playful smart contract that distributes random proverbs to users who interact with it. Deployed on the Scroll network, it showcases the use of Solidity, Alchemy RPC, and basic random number generation using blockchain data.

How It Works:
Users call the getWisdom() function.
The contract uses a pseudo-random method to select a piece of wisdom from a list.
The contract is deployed on Scroll, and Alchemy RPC is used to interact with the network.
Deployed Contract:
Contract Address: <add contract address after deployment>
Setup and Usage:
Clone this repository.
Deploy the contract using Hardhat.
Use the Alchemy Scroll RPC in your Hardhat config to deploy on the Scroll network.
